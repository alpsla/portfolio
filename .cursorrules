# QA Team Portfolio - Cursor AI Configuration
# Collaborative development ruleset for multiple team members

You are an expert in TypeScript, React, Next.js, and collaborative software development.

## 🤝 TEAM COLLABORATION SETTINGS

### Git Workflow
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches from main
- **Naming Convention**: feature/[initials]-[feature-name] (e.g., feature/ar-unified-framework)
- **Commit Format**: type(scope): description (e.g., feat(dashboard): add metrics display)
- **PR Required**: All changes via pull request with review

### Code Ownership
```
/src/app/projects/unified-framework  -> Team Member 1
/src/app/projects/code-coverage      -> Team Member 2  
/src/app/projects/chatbot            -> Team Member 3
/src/app/projects/dashboards         -> Team Member 4
/src/components/                     -> Shared (coordinate in team chat)
```

### File Locking Prevention
- **No Conflicting Edits**: Each developer works on assigned sections
- **Shared Components**: Discuss in team before modifying
- **Styles**: Only modify your section's styles, use component-scoped CSS
- **Types**: Centralize in /src/lib/types, coordinate changes

### Communication Markers
When writing code, include:
```typescript
// TODO: [initials] - description
// FIXME: [initials] - issue description  
// NOTE: [initials] - important note for team
// BLOCKED: [initials] - waiting on [teammate/component]
```

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (no inline styles)
- **Components**: Radix UI for accessibility
- **State**: React Context (no Redux unless agreed)
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier (auto-format on save)

### Folder Structure (Strict Adherence)
```
/portfolio
  /src
    /app                          # Pages (route-based ownership)
      /projects
        /unified-framework        # Owner: Member 1
        /code-coverage           # Owner: Member 2
        /chatbot                 # Owner: Member 3
        /dashboards              # Owner: Member 4
    /components
      /shared                    # Team shared components
      /[feature-name]           # Feature-specific components
    /lib
      /types                    # Shared TypeScript types
      /utils                    # Shared utilities
      /constants               # Shared constants
```

### Component Creation Rules
```typescript
/**
 * Component: ComponentName
 * Author: [Your Initials]
 * Created: YYYY-MM-DD
 * Modified: YYYY-MM-DD by [Initials]
 * Description: Brief description
 */

interface ComponentProps {
  // Props must be documented
  propName: string; // Description of what this does
}

export function ComponentName({ propName }: ComponentProps) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Naming Conventions (Team Consistency)
- **Files**: kebab-case (unified-framework.tsx)
- **Components**: PascalCase (UnifiedFramework)
- **Functions**: camelCase (handleSubmit)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (MAX_RETRIES)
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase with I/T prefix (IProjectData, TStatus)

### CSS/Styling Rules
```css
/* Component-specific styles only */
/* No global style modifications without team agreement */
/* Use Tailwind classes, avoid custom CSS unless necessary */

/* If custom CSS needed: */
.feature-[yourfeature]-[element] {
  /* Namespace to prevent conflicts */
}
```

## 📝 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Before Starting Work
1. Pull latest from main
2. Create feature branch
3. Check team board for conflicts
4. Announce in team chat what you're working on

### While Developing
1. Follow the assigned sections
2. Don't modify others' sections without permission
3. Use TypeScript strictly (no any types)
4. Add JSDoc comments for public functions
5. Write tests for your components

### Before Committing
1. Run linter: `npm run lint`
2. Run tests: `npm test`
3. Build check: `npm run build`
4. Self-review changes

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Follows naming conventions
- [ ] TypeScript types included
- [ ] No conflicts with other sections
- [ ] Tests included/updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No console.logs
- [ ] Accessibility considered

## 🤖 AI ASSISTANT INSTRUCTIONS

When generating code for team members:

### Always Include
1. Author comment at top of new files
2. TypeScript interfaces for all props
3. Error boundaries for new sections
4. Loading states
5. Mobile responsiveness

### Never Do
1. Modify files outside assigned section without noting
2. Use inline styles
3. Create global CSS changes
4. Add dependencies without team discussion
5. Remove others' TODO/FIXME comments

### Conflict Prevention
When multiple team members might edit same file:
```typescript
// START: [Initials] - Feature Name
// Your code here
// END: [Initials] - Feature Name
```

## 📊 SHARED DATA STRUCTURES

### Project Data Interface (All team members use)
```typescript
interface IProject {
  id: string;
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  owner: string; // Team member responsible
  summary: string;
  problem: string;
  solution: string;
  techStack: string[];
  metrics: IMetric[];
  videoUrl?: string;
  screenshots: string[];
  status: 'draft' | 'review' | 'complete';
}

interface IMetric {
  label: string;
  value: string;
  improvement?: string;
  impact?: string;
}
```

### Shared Constants
```typescript
// src/lib/constants/projects.ts
export const PROJECTS: IProject[] = [
  // Each team member adds their project data here
];

// src/lib/constants/team.ts  
export const TEAM_MEMBERS = {
  MEMBER_1: { initials: 'AR', section: 'unified-framework' },
  MEMBER_2: { initials: 'XX', section: 'code-coverage' },
  // Add all team members
};
```

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE GENERATOR

When asked to create implementation guidance, structure as:

### Phase 1: Setup (All Team Members)
```
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies: npm install
3. Create feature branch: git checkout -b feature/[initials]-setup
4. Copy .env.example to .env.local
5. Run development server: npm run dev
```

### Phase 2: Individual Sections (Parallel Work)
```
Team Member 1:
- Create /app/projects/unified-framework/page.tsx
- Add components in /components/unified-framework/
- Update PROJECTS constant with your data

Team Member 2:
- Create /app/projects/code-coverage/page.tsx
- Add components in /components/code-coverage/
- Update PROJECTS constant with your data

[Continue for each member...]
```

### Phase 3: Integration (Team Lead)
```
1. Review all PRs
2. Merge feature branches
3. Test integrated application
4. Deploy to staging
```

## 🔄 CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION

### Pre-commit Hooks (Automatic)
```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged",
      "commit-msg": "commitlint -E HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"
    }
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{ts,tsx}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"],
    "*.css": ["prettier --write"]
  }
}
```

### GitHub Actions (Automatic on PR)
```yaml
- Run TypeScript check
- Run ESLint
- Run tests
- Build project
- Check for conflicts
```

## 💬 COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

### Daily Sync
- Post in team chat what you're working on
- Flag any blockers
- Announce PR reviews needed

### Before Major Changes
- Discuss in team chat
- Get consensus on approach
- Update this ruleset if needed

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

Track and celebrate:
- Zero merge conflicts
- All PRs reviewed within 4 hours  
- 100% TypeScript coverage
- All sections completed on schedule
- Consistent code style across project

## Remember
This is a TEAM project. Success comes from:
- Clear communication
- Respecting boundaries

- Celebrating together

When in doubt, ASK THE TEAM!

## 🔐 INTERNAL VS EXTERNAL BUILDS

- Environment flag: `NEXT_PUBLIC_MODE` is either `internal` or `external`.
- Internal build includes links to GitHub/Confluence/JIRA/NPAW and raw documents.
- External build redacts sensitive content and links; presents concepts and benefits only.

Sanitization helpers must be used before rendering any project/link/attachment.

## Notes

- Rostislav and Alpin Rostislav refer to the same teammate (AR).
- Platforms covered include Web, WCTV, Roku, Apple TV, iOS, and Android (mobile/TV).
