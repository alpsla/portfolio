REPORT PORTAL - HERO IMAGE PROMPT
==================================

Create a professional technical infographic (1920x1080px, 16:9) showing a TestOps reporting platform that centralizes test results from multiple frameworks into unified analytics dashboards.

LAYOUT - DATA FLOW VISUALIZATION (Left to Right):

LEFT SECTION (25%): "Test Execution Sources"
- Title: "Test Frameworks"
- Multiple test framework icons stacked vertically:
  1. Java icon - "Unit Tests"
  2. Playwright icon - "E2E Tests"
  3. Selenium icon - "Web Tests"
  4. API/Postman icon - "Integration Tests"
  5. Cypress icon - "UI Tests"
- Test result data streams flowing right toward center
- Color: Blue (#3b82f6) for "test execution"

CENTER SECTION (25%): "Report Portal Platform"
- Large Report Portal logo/icon
- Title: "Centralized Test Reporting & Analytics"
- Analytics engine icon/brain
- Key features listed:
  * "Flaky Test Detection"
  * "Pattern Recognition"
  * "Historical Trend Analysis"
  * "Real-Time Reporting"
- Glowing center with test result streams flowing in and out
- Data aggregation visualization
- Color: Purple (#8b5cf6) for "analytics processing"

RIGHT SECTION (50%): "Dual Dashboard Outputs"
Split into two dashboard previews:

TOP DASHBOARD (Test Results View):
- Title: "Unified Test Dashboard"
- Icon: 📊 Test Execution icon
- Mini dashboard preview showing:
  * Test execution bar chart
  * "Pass Rate: 92%"
  * "Tests Executed: 1,247"
  * "Flaky Tests: 12 identified"
  * Test status breakdown (pass/fail/skip)
  * Recent test run timeline
- Color: Green (#10b981) for "test execution"

BOTTOM DASHBOARD (Analytics View):
- Title: "Trend Analysis & Insights"
- Icon: 📈 Analytics icon
- Mini dashboard preview showing:
  * Historical trend chart
  * "Release Confidence: 85%"
  * "Triage Time Saved: 60%"
  * "Failure Pattern Detection: 8 patterns"
  * Flaky test identification highlights
  * Failure pattern visualization
- Color: Orange (#f59e0b) for "analytics insights"

CONNECTING ELEMENTS:
- Flowing data streams from test frameworks through Report Portal to dashboards
- Animated test result packets moving along the flow
- "Flaky Detection" badge on the flow to analytics dashboard
- "Real-Time" indicator on data streams
- "Pattern Recognition" label on analytics stream

TOP BANNER:
- "Report Portal"
- "Centralized Test Reporting & Analytics Platform"

BOTTOM METRICS BAR:
- "Multi-Framework Support"
- "Flaky Test Detection"
- "Accelerated Triage"
- "Historical Trend Analysis"

VISUAL STYLE:
- Background: Dark blue-purple gradient (#1a1f2e to #3d2f5e)
- Data flow lines: Flowing purple-blue (#8b5cf6) with animated dots
- Framework icons: Full color on dark backgrounds
- Dashboard previews: Mini screenshots/wireframes with clean charts
- Modern TestOps/analytics aesthetic
- Professional test reporting visualization style
- Emphasis on data centralization and analytics

ALTERNATE SIMPLER CONCEPT:

3-Panel Layout:

LEFT PANEL (Blue): "Scattered Test Results"
- Multiple disconnected test framework icons
- Red X or broken links
- "Fragmented Reporting" label
- "Manual analysis required"

CENTER PANEL (Purple): "Report Portal Centralization"
- Report Portal platform
- Analytics engine icon
- "Unified" label
- Test result streams connecting

RIGHT PANEL (Green/Orange): "Actionable Dashboards"
- Two dashboard icons stacked
- Test Results Dashboard (top) - execution metrics icon
- Analytics Dashboard (bottom) - trends and insights icon
- "Smart Insights" label
- Green checkmarks

Bottom metrics same as above.

KEY MESSAGE TO CONVEY:
- Multiple test frameworks unified into one reporting platform
- Two different dashboard views: test execution and analytics
- Automated flaky test detection and pattern recognition
- Accelerated triage through centralized analytics
- Historical trend analysis for release confidence
- Eliminates manual test result aggregation

Technical Requirements:
- 1920x1080px, 16:9 aspect ratio
- SVG format preferred (or PNG/WebP)
- Under 500KB optimized
- Readable when scaled to 800px
- Modern TestOps/analytics dashboard aesthetic
