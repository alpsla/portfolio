- Multiple test framework icons stacked:
  1. Java - "Unit Tests"
  2. Playwright - "E2E Tests"
  3. Selenium - "Web Tests"
  4. API Tests - "Integration Tests"
- Test results flowing as data streams

CENTER: "Report Portal Platform" (Purple/Blue theme)
- Report Portal logo/icon
- Central processing hub with analytics engine
- Features: Flaky Test Detection, Pattern Recognition, Historical Trends, Real-Time Analysis
- Data aggregation visualization
- Glowing with test result streams

RIGHT: "Analytics Dashboard Output" (Split view)

TOP Dashboard (Green) - Test Results View:
- Title: "Unified Test Dashboard"
- Mini dashboard with test execution charts
- Metrics: "Pass Rate: 92%", "Tests Executed: 1,247", "Flaky Tests: 12"
- Test status visualization (pass/fail/skip)

BOTTOM Dashboard (Orange) - Analytics View:
- Title: "Trend Analysis & Insights"
- Mini dashboard with analytics
- Shows: "Historical Trends", "Failure Patterns", "Release Confidence: 85%", "Triage Time Saved: 60%"

==============================

ULTRA-SHORT VERSION:

Data flow diagram: Multiple test frameworks (Java, Playwright, Selenium, API) on left in blue, flowing through central purple Report Portal platform with analytics engine, outputting to two dashboard previews on right (test results dashboard in green showing execution metrics, analytics dashboard in orange showing trends and flaky test detection). Flowing purple data streams, dark gradient background, modern TestOps dashboard aesthetic, 16:9 landscape. Metrics: Multi-framework, flaky detection, accelerated triage.
