UNIFIED TEST AUTOMATION FRAMEWORK - HERO IMAGE PROMPT
=======================================================

Create a professional technical infographic (1920x1080px, 16:9) showing a unified automation framework that connects one codebase to multiple platforms.

LAYOUT - CENTER HUB WITH RADIATING CONNECTIONS:

CENTER (30%): "Unified Framework Core"
- Large central hub/engine icon representing the unified framework
- Title: "Unified Test Automation"
- Subtitle: "Write Once, Run Everywhere"
- Code icon showing TypeScript/test code with "90% Reusable" badge
- Glowing center with energy radiating outward
- Color: Bright white/blue glow (#3b82f6)

RADIATING PLATFORMS (6 platforms in circle around center):
Each platform connected to center hub with flowing data lines

1. APPLE TV (top-right, 12 o'clock position)
   - Apple TV icon/logo
   - "Apple TV" label
   - Green checkmark

2. iOS (2 o'clock position)
   - iPhone icon
   - "iOS Mobile" label
   - Green checkmark

3. ANDROID (4 o'clock position)
   - Android robot icon + tablet/phone icons
   - "Android (Mobile, Tablet, TV, Fire TV)" label
   - Green checkmark

4. ROKU (6 o'clock position)
   - Roku logo
   - "Roku" label
   - Green checkmark

5. WCTV (8 o'clock position)
   - Connected TV icon
   - "WCTV" label
   - Green checkmark

6. WEB (10 o'clock position)
   - Browser/globe icon
   - "Web" label
   - Green checkmark

CONNECTING ELEMENTS:
- Animated flowing lines from center hub to each platform
- Data packets/dots moving along the lines
- Each connection line labeled with "10% adaptation"
- Visual emphasis on code flowing from center to all platforms

TOP BANNER:
- "Unified Test Automation Framework"
- "One Codebase. All Platforms. 11-13 Applications."

BOTTOM METRICS:
- "90% Code Reuse" with reuse icon
- "6 Platforms" with checkmarks
- "11-13 Apps" with app grid icon
- "Weeks → Days" with time reduction arrow

LEFT SIDE HIGHLIGHT BOX:
"Traditional Approach" (in red/gray, crossed out)
- 6 separate codebases icon
- "Write tests 6× for each platform"
- "Massive duplication"

RIGHT SIDE HIGHLIGHT BOX:
"Unified Approach" (in green, highlighted)
- Single codebase icon
- "Write once + 10% adaptation"
- "90% reuse across platforms"

VISUAL STYLE:
- Background: Dark blue gradient (#1a1f2e to #2d3748)
- Central hub: Bright glowing blue/white (#3b82f6 to #ffffff)
- Platform icons: Full color logos on dark backgrounds
- Connection lines: Flowing animated blue (#3b82f6)
- Data flow: Small moving dots/packets along lines
- Success indicators: Green checkmarks (#10b981)
- Modern, clean, technical aesthetic
- Emphasis on "hub and spoke" architecture
- Professional software tool visualization

ALTERNATE CONCEPT (if circular layout too complex):

Linear 3-step workflow:

STEP 1 (Left - Orange): "Before"
- Stack of 6 platform icons piled up
- Text: "6 Separate Codebases"
- "Same tests written 6× "
- Red X icon
- "Weeks of development"

STEP 2 (Center - Blue): "Unified Framework"
- Large framework hub icon
- Code snippet showing unified test
- "Write Once" badge
- Intelligent adapter icons
- Brain/AI icon

STEP 3 (Right - Green): "After"
- One codebase branching to 6 platforms
- "90% Reuse" badge
- "10% Adaptation per platform"
- Green checkmarks on all platforms
- "Days instead of weeks"

Bottom metrics bar same as above

Technical Requirements:
- 1920x1080px, 16:9 aspect ratio
- PNG or WebP format
- Under 500KB optimized
- Readable when scaled to 800px
- Modern software tool aesthetic
- High contrast for visibility

KEY MESSAGE TO CONVEY:
- One unified framework connects to all platforms
- 90% code reuse with only 10% platform-specific adaptation
- Dramatic time savings (weeks → days)
- Supports 11-13 applications across 6 platforms
- Revolutionary approach vs traditional separate implementations
