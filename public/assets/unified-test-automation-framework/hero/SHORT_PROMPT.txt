UNIFIED TEST AUTOMATION FRAMEWORK - SHORT PROMPT
==================================================

COPY THIS (for ChatGPT DALL-E, Claude, or similar):

Create a professional technical diagram in 16:9 landscape format showing a unified test automation framework connecting one codebase to multiple platforms.

CENTER HUB: "Unified Framework Core"
- Large glowing central hub icon
- "Write Once, Run Everywhere"
- Code icon with "90% Reusable" badge
- Bright blue/white glow (#3b82f6)

8 PLATFORMS RADIATING FROM CENTER (in circle):
Connected with flowing blue data lines showing "10% adaptation" on each

1. Apple TV (top-right) - Apple TV icon, green checkmark
2. iOS (right) - iPhone icon, green checkmark
3. Android Mobile (bottom-right) - Phone/tablet icons, green checkmark
4. Android TV (bottom) - Android TV icon, green checkmark
5. Fire TV (bottom-left) - Fire TV icon, green checkmark
6. Roku (left) - Roku logo, green checkmark
7. WCTV (top-left) - Connected TV icon, green checkmark
8. Web (top) - Browser icon, green checkmark

COMPARISON BOXES:
Left (Red/crossed out): "Traditional: 6+ separate codebases, write tests 6× times, weeks of work"
Right (Green/highlighted): "Unified: One codebase, 90% reuse, 10% adaptation, days instead of weeks"

TOP BANNER: "Unified Test Automation Framework | One Codebase. All Platforms. 11-13 Applications."

BOTTOM METRICS: "90% Code Reuse | 8+ Platforms | 11-13 Apps | Weeks → Days"

Dark gradient background (#1a1f2e to #2d3748), flowing animated data lines, modern software architecture visualization, hub-and-spoke design, professional enterprise aesthetic.

===================================================

ULTRA-SHORT VERSION (for strict limits):

Technical hub-and-spoke architecture diagram: central glowing blue framework hub connected to 8 platform icons (Apple TV, iOS, Android Mobile/Tablet, Android TV, Fire TV, Roku, WCTV, Web) via flowing data lines. Each line labeled "10% adaptation". Comparison boxes showing "before: 6+ codebases" vs "after: one codebase, 90% reuse". Dark gradient background, modern software tool aesthetic, 16:9 landscape. Metrics: 90% reuse, 8+ platforms, 11-13 apps, weeks to days.
