A professional technical infographic showing an intelligent software testing workflow in 4 connected panels, modern dark tech aesthetic, 16:9 aspect ratio, landscape orientation.

Panel 1 (left, orange theme): "Code Changes Detected" - Git branch icon, text "Build #247 - 15 files changed", file names "PaymentProcessor.java", "UserAuth.java", "VideoPlayer.java", Android and Roku platform logos at bottom

Panel 2 (center-left, blue theme): "Coverage Mapping" - Brain/AI network icon, text "342 methods analyzed", "Test-to-code mapping active", visual network of connecting lines between code and tests, "87%" in large green text, "23 unused methods" in small orange text

Panel 3 (center-right, green theme): "Intelligent Test Selection" - Checkmark filter icon, text "Tests to Run: 47 of 1,200" in green, "Tests to Create: 8 new" in yellow, "Tests Skipped: 1,153" crossed out in gray, time comparison "2-3 days → 4-6 hours" with downward arrow, "90%+ reduction" gauge meter

Panel 4 (right, purple theme): "Automated Execution" - Rocket automation icon, text "Regression: 47 tests queued", "New Tests: 8 created", Jenkins and GitHub Actions badge icons, "Ready in hours vs days"

Design elements: flowing arrows connecting each panel from left to right, subtle data flow lines between sections, top banner with "DART - Dynamic Analysis Routine Tester" and subtitle "Intelligent Test Selection & Optimization", bottom metrics bar showing "Time Saved: Days → Hours", "Coverage: Method-Level", "Platforms: Android + Roku", "Dead Code: Auto-detected"

Background: dark blue-gray gradient (#1a1f2e to #2d3748), subtle circuit board pattern overlay, professional software development aesthetic, clean modern sans-serif typography, soft glow effects around panels for depth, smooth color transitions

Color palette: orange/amber (#f59e0b) for panel 1, electric blue (#3b82f6) for panel 2, green (#10b981) for panel 3, purple (#8b5cf6) for panel 4, white and light gray text, dark professional background

Style: technical infographic, modern UI/UX design, data visualization, professional software tool marketing image, clean and uncluttered, enterprise software aesthetic, high contrast for readability

ALTERNATIVE SIMPLER VERSION (if above is too complex):

A modern dark-themed dashboard showing software testing intelligence. Center display: large circular gauge showing "87%" code coverage in gradient green to blue. Above: "DART - Dynamic Analysis Routine Tester" logo. Left side: Android and Roku platform icons. Right side: three metric boxes displaying "Tests Run: 47 of 1,200" (green), "Time: Days → Hours" (orange), "Dead Code: 23 detected" (gray). Bottom row: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and New Relic integration badges. Background: dark blue gradient (#1a1f2e to #2d3748) with subtle code pattern overlay. Visual style: professional technical dashboard, modern software tool interface, clean data visualization, enterprise quality.

TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS:
1. If the tool generates text incorrectly, you may need to add the text in post-processing using design tools
2. Focus on getting the layout, colors, and overall visual structure correct
3. May need 2-3 iterations to get the perfect result
4. Save as PNG, 1920x1080px resolution
5. Ensure final file size is under 500KB for web optimization
