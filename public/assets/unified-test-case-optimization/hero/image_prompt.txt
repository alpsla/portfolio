UNIFIED TEST CASE OPTIMIZATION - HERO IMAGE PROMPT
==================================================

Create a professional test case collaboration visualization (1920x1080px, 16:9) showing the transformation from fragmented platform-specific test cases to unified, platform-neutral test cases shared across all teams through collaborative review.

LAYOUT - BEFORE/PROCESS/AFTER TRANSFORMATION (Left to Right):

LEFT SECTION (30%): "Before - Fragmented Test Cases"
- Title: "Fragmented & Duplicated"
- 8 platform icons arranged in scattered chaos:
  * Apple TV
  * iOS
  * Android Mobile
  * Android Tablet
  * Android TV
  * Fire TV
  * Roku
  * Web/WCTV
- Each platform has its own test case documents (showing duplication)
- Visual indicators of problems:
  * Red X marks for "Outdated"
  * Warning symbols for "Partially Changed"
  * Question marks for "Duplicates?"
  * Disconnected/broken links between platforms
- Test case icons specific to each platform (no sharing)
- Color: Red/Orange (#ef4444 to #f59e0b) for "problems"
- Labels: "30% Redundancy", "No Coordination", "Platform-Locked"

CENTER SECTION (40%): "Collaborative Review Process"
- Title: "Unified Test Case Structure"
- Large central repository/database icon showing unified test cases
- Platform-neutral test case document at center
- Features highlighted:
  * "Platform-Neutral Steps"
  * "App-Neutral Structure"
  * "Generalized Flows"
- Collaborative review workflow visualization:
  * One team member creating/updating test (highlighted)
  * Arrows pointing to 3+ reviewer avatars from different platforms
  * Approval checkmarks from each reviewer
  * "Min. 3 Approvers" badge
  * "Different Platforms" indicator
- 5-Phase approach shown as circular workflow:
  1. "Review & Identify"
  2. "Optimize Flows"
  3. "Generalize Steps"
  4. "Dry-Run & Execute"
  5. "Maintain & Approve"
- Color: Blue (#3b82f6) for "collaboration"
- Flowing connection lines showing test case sharing

RIGHT SECTION (30%): "After - Unified & Shared"
- Title: "One Creates, All Reuse"
- Same 8 platform icons, but now organized in unified circle
- All platforms connected to central test repository
- Green checkmarks everywhere showing:
  * "30% Reduction"
  * "60% Faster Execution"
  * "Universal Quality"
  * "No Duplication"
- Visual flow: One team creates → 3+ approve → All teams access
- Arrows showing "Free Reuse" from central repository to all platforms
- Badge: "Foundation for 90% Code Reuse"
- Color: Green (#10b981) for "success"
- Connected/unified appearance with strong links

CONNECTING ELEMENTS:
- Transformation arrows from left to center to right
- Before/After comparison emphasis
- Data flow showing test cases moving from fragmented to unified
- Collaboration icons (people working together)
- Review/approval workflow with checkmarks
- "Single Source of Truth" badge in center

TOP BANNER:
- "Unified Test Case Optimization"
- "Foundation for Cross-Platform Test Automation"

BOTTOM METRICS BAR:
- "30% Test Reduction"
- "60% Faster Execution"
- "8+ Platforms Unified"
- "3+ Platform Approvers Required"
- "Enabled 90% Code Reuse Framework"

VISUAL STYLE:
- Background: Dark blue-gray gradient (#1a1f2e to #2d3748)
- Before section: Red/orange tones showing problems
- Center section: Blue collaborative workspace
- After section: Green success indicators
- Platform icons: Modern, colorful, recognizable
- Test case documents: Paper/file icons
- Collaboration: People/avatar icons working together
- Professional software development/QA aesthetic
- Emphasis on transformation and collaboration

ALTERNATE SIMPLER CONCEPT - 3-PANEL TRANSFORMATION:

LEFT PANEL (Red/Orange): "Before - Chaos"
- 8 scattered platform icons
- Each with duplicate test documents
- Red X marks, warning symbols
- "30% Redundancy" label
- "Outdated tests"
- "No coordination"
- Broken/disconnected links

CENTER PANEL (Blue): "Collaborative Process"
- Central test case repository
- One person creating/updating (highlighted)
- 3 reviewers from different platforms approving
- "Min. 3 Approvers" badge
- 5 circular phases around center
- "Platform-Neutral Structure" label
- Workflow arrows showing review process

RIGHT PANEL (Green): "After - Unified"
- 8 platforms in organized circle
- All connected to center
- "One Creates, All Reuse" label
- Green checkmarks
- "60% Faster" metric
- "Foundation for Automation" badge
- Strong unified connections

KEY MESSAGE TO CONVEY:
- Foundation that enabled the Unified Test Automation Framework
- Transformation from fragmented to unified test case structure
- Platform-neutral and app-neutral test design
- Collaborative maintenance: one team creates, all reuse for free
- Rigorous quality through 3+ approvers from different platforms
- Eliminated 30% redundancy and 60% execution time
- Created single source of truth across all platforms
- Enabled the later 90% code reuse in automation framework

Technical Requirements:
- 1920x1080px, 16:9 aspect ratio
- PNG or WebP format
- Under 500KB optimized
- Readable when scaled to 800px
- Professional QA/software development workflow aesthetic
- Clear before/after transformation visual
- Emphasis on collaboration and review process
