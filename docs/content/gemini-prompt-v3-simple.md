# GEMINI PROMPT V3 - SIMPLIFIED APPROACH

## The Problem:
Gemini keeps cutting off the right side and creating duplicate nodes. Let's simplify.

---

## COPY THIS SIMPLIFIED PROMPT:

Create a 16:9 landscape data pipeline visualization with THREE equal sections side-by-side:

**SECTION 1 (LEFT) - DATA SOURCES:**
- 6 device icons vertically arranged (TV, phone, android, etc)
- Colored lines (cyan, green, orange) flowing from each icon toward the right

**SECTION 2 (MIDDLE) - PIPELINE:**
- At top: "OpenTelemetry Hub" funnel where colored lines converge
- Below funnel, THREE circular nodes stacked vertically:
  1. Blue circle labeled "KAFKA" (top)
  2. Green circle with snowflake icon labeled "Snowflake" (middle)
  3. Orange circle labeled "Monte Carlo" (bottom)
- ONLY these three nodes, no others
- Connect them with downward flowing lines

**SECTION 3 (RIGHT) - DASHBOARD:**
- Large white rectangular panel with rounded corners
- Inside panel: Text "70% ↓" at top
- Below that: Grid of 20 small colored squares (5 across, 4 down):
  * 6 squares colored BRIGHT GREEN with checkmark ✓
  * 2 squares colored RED with X mark ✗
  * 1 square colored ORANGE with warning ⚠
  * 11 squares colored LIGHT GRAY (faded)
- At bottom: Progress bar (30% green, 70% gray)

**COMPOSITION:**
- Dark navy blue background across entire image
- Show ALL THREE sections in one image - LEFT + MIDDLE + RIGHT
- Each section takes up 1/3 of the width
- Colored data lines flow: left → middle → right
- The right dashboard panel must be fully visible
- Aspect ratio: 16:9 landscape (like a widescreen TV)

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- ❌ DO NOT cut off the right side - show complete image
- ❌ DO NOT create duplicate Snowflake nodes - only ONE green Snowflake circle in middle section
- ❌ DO NOT add extra nodes beyond the three specified (Kafka, Snowflake, Monte Carlo)
- ✅ MUST show white dashboard panel on right with colored test grid
- ✅ MUST be wide 16:9 landscape showing all three sections

Style: Modern tech illustration, glowing effects, dark background, professional

## ALTERNATIVE: If above doesn't work, try this ultra-basic version:

Create a wide 16:9 diagram showing:
1. LEFT: 6 icons with colored streams
2. MIDDLE: Funnel at top, then 3 stacked circles (blue Kafka, green Snowflake, orange Monte Carlo)
3. RIGHT: White panel with colored grid (6 green boxes, 2 red boxes, 1 orange box, 11 gray boxes) and "70%" text

Dark background. Show the complete wide image with all three parts. Don't crop the right side.

---

## IF GEMINI STILL STRUGGLES:

Tell Gemini: "Generate a WIDE horizontal 16:9 landscape image. Do not crop or cut off any side. The image must show three distinct sections from left to right: data sources, processing pipeline, and output dashboard. Make sure the entire width is visible in the final image."
