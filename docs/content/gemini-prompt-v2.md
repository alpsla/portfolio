# GEMINI PROMPT V2 - Complete Right Side

## COPY THIS TO GEMINI:

---

Create a COMPLETE 16:9 landscape technical illustration for a data observability platform with dark navy blue background (#0A1628). The image MUST show THREE distinct sections: LEFT (data sources), CENTER (processing pipeline), and RIGHT (intelligence output dashboard).

## LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:

The image must be divided into THREE EQUAL SECTIONS horizontally:
- LEFT third (0-33%): Data sources with icons
- CENTER third (33-66%): Processing pipeline with OpenTelemetry and nodes
- RIGHT third (66-100%): Intelligence Output dashboard ⚠️ THIS IS CRITICAL - DON'T CUT THIS OFF!

## LEFT SECTION (first 33% of width):

Header: "DATA SOURCES"

6 platform icons vertically:
- Connected TV
- TV  
- Logs/Media Player
- iPon (phone icon)
- Andoes
- Android

Add legend at top right: Green circle "Metrics", Orange circle "Traces"

From each icon, draw thin glowing curved lines flowing RIGHT toward center:
- CYAN lines (logs)
- BRIGHT GREEN lines (metrics)
- ORANGE lines (traces)

## CENTER SECTION (middle 33% of width):

Header: "OpenTelemetry" at top

**OpenTelemetry Hub**: Large funnel/hourglass shape at top where all colored streams from left converge

**Below the OpenTelemetry funnel, stack these 3 nodes VERTICALLY:**

1. **KAFKA** (top node):
   - Medium blue circular node with white "K" icon
   - Label: "KAFKA" (all caps)
   - Data streams flow INTO this from OpenTelemetry above

2. **SNOWFLAKE** (middle node):
   - Medium-large BRIGHT GREEN circular node with white snowflake ❄️ icon
   - Label: "Snowflake" 
   - Glowing effect
   - Data flows from Kafka INTO this node

3. **MONTE CARLO** (bottom node): ⚠️ CRITICAL - MUST BE IN CENTER SECTION
   - Large ORANGE circular node with "MC" or analytics icon
   - Label: "Monte Carlo"
   - Below label: smaller text "Observability analysis platform"
   - Strong glow effect (brightest node)
   - Data flows from Snowflake INTO this node
   - From this node, colored streams flow RIGHT toward the dashboard

Connect all three nodes with curved lines showing downward flow: OpenTelemetry → Kafka → Snowflake → Monte Carlo

⚠️ All three nodes (Kafka, Snowflake, Monte Carlo) must be in the CENTER section, vertically stacked!

## RIGHT SECTION (final 33% of width): ⚠️ MUST BE VISIBLE, DON'T CUT OFF!

Header: "Intelligence Output"

Large WHITE rectangular panel with rounded corners (like a dashboard/window) containing:

**Inside the white panel:**

1. **Large "70%" metric at top** with downward arrow ↓

2. **Test Results Grid** (CRITICAL - MAIN FEATURE):
   - 5 columns × 4 rows = 20 small rounded square boxes
   - Each box clearly visible with these EXACT colors distributed throughout grid:
     * **6 boxes**: BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF88) with white checkmark ✓ symbol inside
     * **2 boxes**: BRIGHT RED (#FF4444) with white X mark ✗ symbol inside
     * **1 box**: BRIGHT ORANGE (#FF6B35) with white warning triangle ⚠ symbol inside
     * **11 boxes**: LIGHT GRAY (#555555) - faded/dimmed, no symbols
   - Mix the colored boxes naturally throughout the grid (don't group them)
   - Each box should be clearly visible as a small rounded square

3. **Progress bar at bottom**:
   - Thin horizontal bar below the grid
   - Left 30%: BRIGHT GREEN fill
   - Right 70%: DARK GRAY fill
   - Sharp divider between green and gray sections

The white panel should be prominent and easily readable against the dark background.

## DATA FLOW:

- Colored streams flow LEFT → CENTER (into OpenTelemetry funnel)
- Flow down through CENTER nodes (Kafka → Snowflake → Monte Carlo)
- Streams flow from Monte Carlo RIGHT → to the dashboard
- Show this complete data journey across all three sections

## VISUAL STYLE:

- Dark navy blue background (#0A1628) across entire image
- Soft glowing effects on all nodes and colored streams
- White dashboard panel "pops" with high contrast against dark background
- Clean, modern SaaS product design
- Professional enterprise software visualization
- Smooth curved lines for data flows
- NO photos, NO people, pure vector illustration

## CRITICAL CHECKLIST:

✓ Image shows ALL THREE sections (left, center, right) - full 16:9 composition
✓ RIGHT section with dashboard is FULLY VISIBLE (not cut off)
✓ Monte Carlo node is in CENTER section (not on the right)
✓ Dashboard has colored test boxes (6 green ✓, 2 red ✗, 1 orange ⚠, 11 gray)
✓ Only ONE Snowflake node
✓ Data flows continuously from left through center to right dashboard

Aspect ratio: 16:9 landscape
Resolution: 1920×1080 pixels minimum
DO NOT crop or cut off the right side of the image!

## IF ISSUES:

**If right side is cut off**: "Extend the image to show the complete right third with the Intelligence Output dashboard. The image must be 16:9 landscape showing left data sources, center pipeline, AND right dashboard - all three sections visible."

**If Monte Carlo is on the right**: "Move Monte Carlo node to the center section below Snowflake. Only the white dashboard panel should be on the right."

**If dashboard is missing**: "Add the Intelligence Output white dashboard panel on the right third of the image with the 5×4 colored test grid (6 green checkmarks, 2 red X's, 1 orange warning, 11 gray boxes)."
